Seems like this is where they actually made the app.

R.java is apparently created automatically by the compiler, and I think the Bluetooth file is a rip from something else.

Also, anywhere you see paramBundle as a instance variable from of type Bundle, it is a decompile error,
and it should be a local variable of some sort.

Still trying to work that one out.
